## Executive Summary

The system reached its **breaking point at 1 virtual users** (3.2 requests/second), where error_rate_breach exceeded acceptable thresholds.

**Primary Root Cause:** Baseline performance already degraded before load test (at 1 VUs, 3.2 RPS) (confidence: 65%)

## Breaking Point Analysis

**Classification:** Already Degraded Baseline

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Virtual Users at Break | 1 |
| Requests/Second at Break | 3.2 |
| Failure Type | error_rate_breach |
| Threshold Exceeded | error_rate > 0.1 |
| Observed Value | 0.3625 |
| Threshold Value | 0.1000 |
| Detection Confidence | 65% |

### Observed Signals

- error_rate_breach at 1 VUs
- Observed: 0.3625, Threshold: 0.1000
- Severity: 3.62x threshold
- Error rate: 36.25%
- P95 latency: 26.0ms
- Throughput: 3.2 RPS

### Failure Timeline

| Time | Event | Test Type | VUs | Description |
|------|-------|-----------|-----|-------------|
| t0 | 📈 load_change | baseline | 1 | Load increased to 1 VUs (baseline) |
| t1 | 🔴 error_rate_breach | baseline | 1 | Error rate crossed threshold (36.2% > 10.0%) |
| t2 | 📈 load_change | stress | 15 | Load increased to 15 VUs (stress) |
| t3 | 🔴 error_rate_breach | stress | 15 | Error rate crossed threshold (32.8% > 10.0%) |
| t4 | 🔴 error_rate_breach | spike | 15 | Error rate crossed threshold (32.5% > 10.0%) |

## Root Cause Analysis

**Analysis Mode:** ollama  
**Confidence:** 65%

### Primary Cause

Baseline performance already degraded before load test (at 1 VUs, 3.2 RPS)

### Reasoning

1. Step 1: Analyzed load test results from baseline, stress, and spike tests
2. Step 2: Observed 2 load changes and 3 violations
3. Step 3: First violation at t1: Error rate crossed threshold (36.2% > 10.0%)
4. Step 4: Classification rationale - Baseline test already showed degradation
5.          Baseline error rate exceeded 10.0%
6. Step 5: Classified as already_degraded_baseline

### Supporting Evidence

- Baseline: 15 requests analyzed
- Baseline P95: 309.5ms
- Baseline confidence: VERY_LOW
- Load tests: 4001 total requests
- Average error rate: 33.9%
- Max P95 latency: 26.0ms
- error_rate_breach at 1 VUs
- Observed: 0.3625, Threshold: 0.1000
- Severity: 3.62x threshold

## Recommendations

### 1. Investigate and fix baseline performance issues first

**Priority:** 🔴 1  
**Confidence:** 90%  
**Expected Impact:** Critical - must fix before further testing

System already degraded before load testing

## Load Test Results

| Test Type | VUs | Duration | Requests | Error Rate | P95 Latency | Throughput |
|-----------|-----|----------|----------|------------|-------------|------------|
| baseline | 1 | 26s | 80 | 36.25% | 26ms | 3.2 RPS |
| stress | 15 | 101s | 2738 | 32.80% | 26ms | 27.3 RPS |
| spike | 15 | 45s | 1183 | 32.54% | 26ms | 26.7 RPS |

## Telemetry Analysis

**Collection Time:** 2025-12-21 17:36:37 UTC

### Endpoints Analyzed

7 endpoints were analyzed for traffic patterns.

## Methodology

This analysis was performed using SentinelPerf AI, an autonomous performance engineering agent.

### Analysis Pipeline

1. **Telemetry Analysis** - Inferred traffic patterns from available telemetry
2. **Test Generation** - Generated load, stress, and spike test configurations
3. **Load Execution** - Executed tests using k6 load testing framework
4. **Breaking Point Detection** - Identified first point of failure
5. **Root Cause Analysis** - Determined probable cause using observed signals only

### LLM Rules Enforced

- LLM may NOT invent metrics not present in observed data
- LLM may NOT infer causes without supporting signals
- All reasoning is step-by-step and reproducible
- Confidence scores are based on evidence strength only
