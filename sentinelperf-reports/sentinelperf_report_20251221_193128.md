## Executive Summary

The system reached its **breaking point at 15 virtual users** (9.3 requests/second), where error_rate_breach exceeded acceptable thresholds.

**Primary Root Cause:** Error propagation and cascade effect (confidence: 85%)

## Breaking Point Analysis

**Classification:** Error Driven Collapse

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Virtual Users at Break | 15 |
| Requests/Second at Break | 9.3 |
| Failure Type | error_rate_breach |
| Threshold Exceeded | error_rate > 0.05 |
| Observed Value | 0.1215 |
| Threshold Value | 0.0500 |
| Detection Confidence | 85% |

### Observed Signals

- error_rate_breach at 15 VUs
- Observed: 0.1215, Threshold: 0.0500
- Severity: 2.43x threshold
- Error rate: 12.15%
- P95 latency: 5044.5ms
- Throughput: 9.3 RPS

### Failure Timeline

| Time | Event | Test Type | VUs | Description |
|------|-------|-----------|-----|-------------|
| t0 | 📈 load_change | baseline | 2 | Load increased to 2 VUs (baseline) |
| t1 | 📈 load_change | stress | 15 | Load increased to 15 VUs (stress) |
| t2 | 🔴 error_rate_breach | stress | 15 | Error rate crossed threshold (12.2% > 5.0%) |
| t3 | 🟠 latency_degradation | stress | 15 | Latency slope changed (123.4x increase) |
| t4 | 🟠 latency_degradation | stress | 15 | Latency exceeded threshold (5044ms > 200ms) |
| t5 | 🔴 error_rate_breach | spike | 15 | Error rate crossed threshold (22.3% > 5.0%) |
| t6 | 🟠 latency_degradation | spike | 15 | Latency exceeded threshold (7242ms > 200ms) |

## Root Cause Analysis

**Analysis Mode:** rules  

**Confidence:** 85%

### Summary

Error rate exceeded threshold causing cascading failures at 15 VUs (9.3 RPS)

### Primary Cause

Error propagation and cascade effect

### Contributing Factors

- Error rate exceeded threshold
- Latency degradation detected

### Assumptions

- Load tests accurately simulate production traffic patterns
- Telemetry data reflects actual system behavior

### Limitations

- Analysis based on rules-only (LLM unavailable)
- Low baseline confidence - limited historical data

## Recommendations

### 1. Inspect error types and downstream dependencies

**Priority:** 🔴 P1  
**Risk:** 🟢 LOW  
**Confidence:** 85%

**Rationale:** Errors cascaded causing system collapse (detected at 15 VUs, 9.3 RPS via error_rate_breach)

**Expected Impact:** Identify root cause of error propagation

### 2. Implement circuit breaker pattern

**Priority:** 🟡 P2  
**Risk:** 🟡 MEDIUM  
**Confidence:** 82%

**Rationale:** Prevent cascade failures from propagating

**Expected Impact:** Graceful degradation instead of collapse

### 3. Add rate limiting at entry points

**Priority:** 🟡 P3  
**Risk:** 🟡 MEDIUM  
**Confidence:** 78%

**Rationale:** Protect system from overload-induced errors

**Expected Impact:** Controlled rejection instead of uncontrolled failure

### Limitations

- Recommendations are guidance, not prescriptions
- Actual fixes require system-specific investigation

## Load Test Results

| Test Type | VUs | Duration | Requests | Error Rate | P95 Latency | Throughput |
|-----------|-----|----------|----------|------------|-------------|------------|
| baseline | 2 | 26s | 108 | 0.00% | 41ms | 4.3 RPS |
| stress | 15 | 125s | 1152 | 12.15% | 5044ms | 9.3 RPS |
| spike | 15 | 45s | 211 | 22.27% | 7242ms | 4.8 RPS |

## Telemetry Analysis

No telemetry data was analyzed.

## Methodology

This analysis was performed using SentinelPerf AI, an autonomous performance engineering agent.

### Analysis Pipeline

1. **Telemetry Analysis** - Inferred traffic patterns from available telemetry
2. **Test Generation** - Generated load, stress, and spike test configurations
3. **Load Execution** - Executed tests using k6 load testing framework
4. **Breaking Point Detection** - Identified first point of failure
5. **Root Cause Analysis** - Determined probable cause using observed signals only

### LLM Rules Enforced

- LLM may NOT invent metrics not present in observed data
- LLM may NOT infer causes without supporting signals
- All reasoning is step-by-step and reproducible
- Confidence scores are based on evidence strength only
