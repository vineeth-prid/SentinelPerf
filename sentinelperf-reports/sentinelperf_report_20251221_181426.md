## Executive Summary

The system reached its **breaking point at 1 virtual users** (3.3 requests/second), where error_rate_breach exceeded acceptable thresholds.

**Primary Root Cause:** Pre-existing system issues before load testing (confidence: 85%)

## Breaking Point Analysis

**Classification:** Already Degraded Baseline

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Virtual Users at Break | 1 |
| Requests/Second at Break | 3.3 |
| Failure Type | error_rate_breach |
| Threshold Exceeded | error_rate > 0.05 |
| Observed Value | 0.3415 |
| Threshold Value | 0.0500 |
| Detection Confidence | 65% |

### Observed Signals

- error_rate_breach at 1 VUs
- Observed: 0.3415, Threshold: 0.0500
- Severity: 6.83x threshold
- Error rate: 34.15%
- P95 latency: 29.9ms
- Throughput: 3.3 RPS

### Failure Timeline

| Time | Event | Test Type | VUs | Description |
|------|-------|-----------|-----|-------------|
| t0 | 📈 load_change | baseline | 1 | Load increased to 1 VUs (baseline) |
| t1 | 🔴 error_rate_breach | baseline | 1 | Error rate crossed threshold (34.1% > 5.0%) |
| t2 | 📈 load_change | stress | 15 | Load increased to 15 VUs (stress) |
| t3 | 🔴 error_rate_breach | stress | 15 | Error rate crossed threshold (33.8% > 5.0%) |
| t4 | 🔴 error_rate_breach | spike | 15 | Error rate crossed threshold (32.4% > 5.0%) |

## Root Cause Analysis

**Analysis Mode:** rules  

**Confidence:** 85%

### Summary

System showed degradation even at baseline load levels at 1 VUs (3.3 RPS)

### Primary Cause

Pre-existing system issues before load testing

### Contributing Factors

- Error rate exceeded threshold

### Assumptions

- Load tests accurately simulate production traffic patterns
- Telemetry data reflects actual system behavior

### Limitations

- Analysis based on rules-only (LLM unavailable)
- Low baseline confidence - limited historical data

## Recommendations

*Recommendations will be provided in Phase 6 after root cause validation.*

To enable recommendations:
1. Verify the root cause analysis is accurate
2. Enable recommendations in configuration
3. Run analysis with `--enable-recommendations` flag

## Load Test Results

| Test Type | VUs | Duration | Requests | Error Rate | P95 Latency | Throughput |
|-----------|-----|----------|----------|------------|-------------|------------|
| baseline | 1 | 26s | 82 | 34.15% | 30ms | 3.3 RPS |
| stress | 15 | 61s | 1797 | 33.83% | 30ms | 29.9 RPS |
| spike | 15 | 45s | 1164 | 32.39% | 30ms | 26.4 RPS |

## Telemetry Analysis

**Source:** otel  
**Collection Time:** 2025-12-21 18:12:15 UTC

### Endpoints Analyzed

7 endpoints were analyzed for traffic patterns.

## Methodology

This analysis was performed using SentinelPerf AI, an autonomous performance engineering agent.

### Analysis Pipeline

1. **Telemetry Analysis** - Inferred traffic patterns from available telemetry
2. **Test Generation** - Generated load, stress, and spike test configurations
3. **Load Execution** - Executed tests using k6 load testing framework
4. **Breaking Point Detection** - Identified first point of failure
5. **Root Cause Analysis** - Determined probable cause using observed signals only

### LLM Rules Enforced

- LLM may NOT invent metrics not present in observed data
- LLM may NOT infer causes without supporting signals
- All reasoning is step-by-step and reproducible
- Confidence scores are based on evidence strength only
