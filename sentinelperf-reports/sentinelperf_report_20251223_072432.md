## Executive Summary

The system reached its **breaking point at 22 virtual users** (21.1 requests/second), where error_rate_breach exceeded acceptable thresholds.

**Primary Root Cause:** Error propagation and cascade effect (confidence: 85%)

## Root Cause Analysis

**Analysis Mode:** rules  

**Confidence:** 85%

### Summary

Error rate exceeded threshold causing cascading failures at 22 VUs (21.1 RPS)

### Primary Cause

Error propagation and cascade effect

### Contributing Factors

- Throughput stopped scaling with load
- Error rate exceeded threshold
- Latency degradation detected

### Assumptions

- Load tests accurately simulate production traffic patterns
- Telemetry data reflects actual system behavior

### Limitations

- Analysis based on rules-only (LLM unavailable)
- Low baseline confidence - limited historical data

## Recommendations

### 1. Inspect error types and downstream dependencies

**Priority:** 🔴 P1  
**Risk:** 🟢 LOW  
**Confidence:** 85%

**Rationale:** Errors cascaded causing system collapse (detected at 22 VUs, 21.1 RPS via error_rate_breach)

**Expected Impact:** Identify root cause of error propagation

### 2. Implement circuit breaker pattern

**Priority:** 🟡 P2  
**Risk:** 🟡 MEDIUM  
**Confidence:** 82%

**Rationale:** Prevent cascade failures from propagating

**Expected Impact:** Graceful degradation instead of collapse

### 3. Add rate limiting at entry points

**Priority:** 🟡 P3  
**Risk:** 🟡 MEDIUM  
**Confidence:** 78%

**Rationale:** Protect system from overload-induced errors

**Expected Impact:** Controlled rejection instead of uncontrolled failure

### Limitations

- Recommendations are guidance, not prescriptions
- Actual fixes require system-specific investigation

## Load Test Results

| Test Type | VUs | Duration | Requests | Error Rate | P95 Latency | Throughput |

| adaptive_7vus | 7 | 11s | 106 | 0.00% | 36ms | 10.2 RPS |
| adaptive_12vus | 12 | 11s | 190 | 0.00% | 36ms | 18.3 RPS |
| adaptive_17vus | 17 | 11s | 263 | 0.00% | 36ms | 25.3 RPS |
| adaptive_22vus | 22 | 12s | 245 | 21.22% | 690ms | 21.1 RPS |

## Telemetry Analysis

No telemetry data was analyzed.

## Methodology

This analysis was performed using SentinelPerf AI, an autonomous performance engineering agent.

### Analysis Pipeline

1. **Telemetry Analysis** - Inferred traffic patterns from available telemetry
2. **Test Generation** - Generated load, stress, and spike test configurations
3. **Load Execution** - Executed tests using k6 load testing framework
4. **Breaking Point Detection** - Identified first point of failure
5. **Root Cause Analysis** - Determined probable cause using observed signals only

### LLM Rules Enforced

- LLM may NOT invent metrics not present in observed data
- LLM may NOT infer causes without supporting signals
- All reasoning is step-by-step and reproducible
- Confidence scores are based on evidence strength only
