## Executive Summary

The system reached its **breaking point at 1 virtual users** (3.2 requests/second), where error_rate_breach exceeded acceptable thresholds.

**Primary Root Cause:** Pre-existing system issues before load testing (confidence: 85%)

## Breaking Point Analysis

**Classification:** Already Degraded Baseline

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Virtual Users at Break | 1 |
| Requests/Second at Break | 3.2 |
| Failure Type | error_rate_breach |
| Threshold Exceeded | error_rate > 0.05 |
| Observed Value | 0.2840 |
| Threshold Value | 0.0500 |
| Detection Confidence | 65% |

### Observed Signals

- error_rate_breach at 1 VUs
- Observed: 0.2840, Threshold: 0.0500
- Severity: 5.68x threshold
- Error rate: 28.40%
- P95 latency: 30.8ms
- Throughput: 3.2 RPS

### Failure Timeline

| Time | Event | Test Type | VUs | Description |
|------|-------|-----------|-----|-------------|
| t0 | 📈 load_change | baseline | 1 | Load increased to 1 VUs (baseline) |
| t1 | 🔴 error_rate_breach | baseline | 1 | Error rate crossed threshold (28.4% > 5.0%) |
| t2 | 📈 load_change | stress | 15 | Load increased to 15 VUs (stress) |
| t3 | 🔴 error_rate_breach | stress | 15 | Error rate crossed threshold (33.2% > 5.0%) |
| t4 | 🔴 error_rate_breach | spike | 15 | Error rate crossed threshold (34.7% > 5.0%) |

## Root Cause Analysis

**Analysis Mode:** rules  

**Confidence:** 85%

### Summary

System showed degradation even at baseline load levels at 1 VUs (3.2 RPS)

### Primary Cause

Pre-existing system issues before load testing

### Contributing Factors

- Error rate exceeded threshold

### Assumptions

- Load tests accurately simulate production traffic patterns
- Telemetry data reflects actual system behavior

### Limitations

- Analysis based on rules-only (LLM unavailable)
- Low baseline confidence - limited historical data

## Recommendations

### 1. Fix baseline errors before load testing

**Priority:** 🔴 P1  
**Risk:** 🟢 LOW  
**Confidence:** 88%

**Rationale:** System already degraded at minimal load (detected at 1 VUs, 3.2 RPS via error_rate_breach)

**Expected Impact:** Establish healthy baseline for accurate testing

### 2. Check service health and dependencies

**Priority:** 🟡 P2  
**Risk:** 🟢 LOW  
**Confidence:** 85%

**Rationale:** Baseline errors suggest infrastructure issues

**Expected Impact:** Identify and resolve pre-existing problems

### 3. Review recent deployments or configuration changes

**Priority:** 🟡 P3  
**Risk:** 🟢 LOW  
**Confidence:** 74%

**Rationale:** Baseline degradation may be from recent changes

**Expected Impact:** Rollback if recent change caused degradation

### Limitations

- Recommendations are guidance, not prescriptions
- Actual fixes require system-specific investigation
- Baseline issues must be fixed before further analysis
- Breaking point detection confidence is 65%

## Load Test Results

| Test Type | VUs | Duration | Requests | Error Rate | P95 Latency | Throughput |
|-----------|-----|----------|----------|------------|-------------|------------|
| baseline | 1 | 26s | 81 | 28.40% | 31ms | 3.2 RPS |
| stress | 15 | 61s | 1788 | 33.22% | 30ms | 29.6 RPS |
| spike | 15 | 45s | 1177 | 34.66% | 30ms | 26.5 RPS |

## Telemetry Analysis

**Source:** otel  
**Collection Time:** 2025-12-21 18:27:27 UTC

### Endpoints Analyzed

7 endpoints were analyzed for traffic patterns.

## Methodology

This analysis was performed using SentinelPerf AI, an autonomous performance engineering agent.

### Analysis Pipeline

1. **Telemetry Analysis** - Inferred traffic patterns from available telemetry
2. **Test Generation** - Generated load, stress, and spike test configurations
3. **Load Execution** - Executed tests using k6 load testing framework
4. **Breaking Point Detection** - Identified first point of failure
5. **Root Cause Analysis** - Determined probable cause using observed signals only

### LLM Rules Enforced

- LLM may NOT invent metrics not present in observed data
- LLM may NOT infer causes without supporting signals
- All reasoning is step-by-step and reproducible
- Confidence scores are based on evidence strength only
