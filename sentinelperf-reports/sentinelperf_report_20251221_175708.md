## Executive Summary

The system reached its **breaking point at 50 virtual users** (9.5 requests/second), where latency_degradation exceeded acceptable thresholds.

**Primary Root Cause:** Error cascade caused system collapse (at 50 VUs, 9.5 RPS) (confidence: 88%)

## Breaking Point Analysis

**Classification:** Error Driven Collapse

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Virtual Users at Break | 50 |

## Root Cause Analysis

**Analysis Mode:** ollama  
**Confidence:** 88%

### Primary Cause

Error cascade caused system collapse (at 50 VUs, 9.5 RPS)

### Reasoning

1. Step 1: Analyzed load test results from baseline, stress, and spike tests
2. Step 2: Observed 2 load changes and 8 violations
3. Step 3: First violation at t2: Error rate crossed threshold (5.7% > 5.0%)
4. Step 4: Classification rationale - Errors appeared before or at same load as latency degradation
5.          Error breach at 50 VUs
6.          Errors likely caused cascading failures
7. Step 5: Classified as error_driven_collapse

### Supporting Evidence

- Load tests: 2434 total requests
- Average error rate: 28.7%
- Max P95 latency: 11285.8ms
- latency_degradation at 50 VUs
- Observed: 365.5509, Threshold: 1.5000
- Severity: 243.70x threshold

## Recommendations

### 1. Implement circuit breaker pattern

**Priority:** 🔴 1  
**Confidence:** 80%  
**Expected Impact:** High - prevents cascade failures

Errors cascaded causing system collapse

### 2. Add rate limiting at entry points

**Priority:** 🟡 2  
**Confidence:** 75%  
**Expected Impact:** Medium - trades availability for stability

Protect system from overload-induced errors

## Load Test Results

| Test Type | VUs | Duration | Requests | Error Rate | P95 Latency | Throughput |
|-----------|-----|----------|----------|------------|-------------|------------|
| baseline | 5 | 26s | 278 | 0.00% | 31ms | 11.0 RPS |
| stress | 50 | 150s | 1427 | 5.68% | 11286ms | 9.5 RPS |
| spike | 50 | 75s | 729 | 80.52% | 714ms | 9.9 RPS |

## Telemetry Analysis

No telemetry data was analyzed.

## Methodology

This analysis was performed using SentinelPerf AI, an autonomous performance engineering agent.

### Analysis Pipeline

1. **Telemetry Analysis** - Inferred traffic patterns from available telemetry
2. **Test Generation** - Generated load, stress, and spike test configurations
3. **Load Execution** - Executed tests using k6 load testing framework
4. **Breaking Point Detection** - Identified first point of failure
5. **Root Cause Analysis** - Determined probable cause using observed signals only

### LLM Rules Enforced

- LLM may NOT invent metrics not present in observed data
- LLM may NOT infer causes without supporting signals
- All reasoning is step-by-step and reproducible
- Confidence scores are based on evidence strength only
