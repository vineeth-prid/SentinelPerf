## Executive Summary

The system reached its **breaking point at 50 virtual users** (10.4 requests/second), where latency_degradation exceeded acceptable thresholds.

**Primary Root Cause:** Error propagation and cascade effect (confidence: 85%)

## Breaking Point Analysis

**Classification:** Error Driven Collapse

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Virtual Users at Break | 50 |
| Requests/Second at Break | 10.4 |

## Root Cause Analysis

**Analysis Mode:** rules  

**Confidence:** 85%

### Summary

Error rate exceeded threshold causing cascading failures at 50 VUs (10.4 RPS)

### Primary Cause

Error propagation and cascade effect

### Contributing Factors

- Latency degradation detected
- Resource saturation detected
- Error rate exceeded threshold
- Throughput stopped scaling with load

### Assumptions

- Load tests accurately simulate production traffic patterns
- Telemetry data reflects actual system behavior

### Limitations

- Analysis based on rules-only (LLM unavailable)
- Low baseline confidence - limited historical data

## Recommendations

### 1. Inspect error types and downstream dependencies

**Priority:** 🔴 P1  
**Risk:** 🟢 LOW  
**Confidence:** 85%

**Rationale:** Errors cascaded causing system collapse (detected at 50 VUs, 10.4 RPS via latency_degradation)

**Expected Impact:** Identify root cause of error propagation

### 2. Implement circuit breaker pattern

**Priority:** 🟡 P2  
**Risk:** 🟡 MEDIUM  
**Confidence:** 82%

**Rationale:** Prevent cascade failures from propagating

**Expected Impact:** Graceful degradation instead of collapse

### 3. Add rate limiting at entry points

**Priority:** 🟡 P3  
**Risk:** 🟡 MEDIUM  
**Confidence:** 78%

**Rationale:** Protect system from overload-induced errors

**Expected Impact:** Controlled rejection instead of uncontrolled failure

### Limitations

- Recommendations are guidance, not prescriptions
- Actual fixes require system-specific investigation

## Load Test Results

| Test Type | VUs | Duration | Requests | Error Rate | P95 Latency | Throughput |
|-----------|-----|----------|----------|------------|-------------|------------|
| baseline | 5 | 26s | 277 | 0.00% | 31ms | 11.0 RPS |
| stress | 50 | 151s | 1561 | 4.93% | 6075ms | 10.4 RPS |
| spike | 50 | 75s | 738 | 79.95% | 713ms | 10.0 RPS |

## Telemetry Analysis

No telemetry data was analyzed.

## Methodology

This analysis was performed using SentinelPerf AI, an autonomous performance engineering agent.

### Analysis Pipeline

1. **Telemetry Analysis** - Inferred traffic patterns from available telemetry
2. **Test Generation** - Generated load, stress, and spike test configurations
3. **Load Execution** - Executed tests using k6 load testing framework
4. **Breaking Point Detection** - Identified first point of failure
5. **Root Cause Analysis** - Determined probable cause using observed signals only

### LLM Rules Enforced

- LLM may NOT invent metrics not present in observed data
- LLM may NOT infer causes without supporting signals
- All reasoning is step-by-step and reproducible
- Confidence scores are based on evidence strength only
