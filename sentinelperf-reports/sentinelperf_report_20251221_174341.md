## Executive Summary

No breaking point was detected within the tested load range. The system handled all test scenarios within acceptable thresholds.

**Primary Root Cause:** No failure detected within test parameters (confidence: 95%)

## Breaking Point Analysis

**Classification:** No Failure

No breaking point detected within tested parameters.

## Root Cause Analysis

**Analysis Mode:** ollama  
**Confidence:** 95%

### Primary Cause

No failure detected within test parameters

### Reasoning

1. Step 1: Analyzed load test results from baseline, stress, and spike tests
2. Step 2: Observed 2 load changes and 0 violations
3. Step 4: Classification rationale - No violations detected
4. Step 5: Classified as no_failure

### Supporting Evidence

- Load tests: 7049 total requests
- Average error rate: 0.0%
- Max P95 latency: 25.8ms

## Recommendations

### 1. Increase load test intensity to find actual limits

**Priority:** 🔴 1  
**Confidence:** 70%  
**Expected Impact:** Medium - helps establish true capacity

No breaking point found within test parameters

## Load Test Results

| Test Type | VUs | Duration | Requests | Error Rate | P95 Latency | Throughput |
|-----------|-----|----------|----------|------------|-------------|------------|
| baseline | 2 | 26s | 119 | 0.00% | 26ms | 4.7 RPS |
| stress | 25 | 121s | 5020 | 0.00% | 26ms | 41.8 RPS |
| spike | 25 | 45s | 1910 | 0.00% | 26ms | 43.2 RPS |

## Telemetry Analysis

No telemetry data was analyzed.

## Methodology

This analysis was performed using SentinelPerf AI, an autonomous performance engineering agent.

### Analysis Pipeline

1. **Telemetry Analysis** - Inferred traffic patterns from available telemetry
2. **Test Generation** - Generated load, stress, and spike test configurations
3. **Load Execution** - Executed tests using k6 load testing framework
4. **Breaking Point Detection** - Identified first point of failure
5. **Root Cause Analysis** - Determined probable cause using observed signals only

### LLM Rules Enforced

- LLM may NOT invent metrics not present in observed data
- LLM may NOT infer causes without supporting signals
- All reasoning is step-by-step and reproducible
- Confidence scores are based on evidence strength only
