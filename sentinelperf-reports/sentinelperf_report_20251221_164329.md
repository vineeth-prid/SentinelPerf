## Executive Summary

No breaking point was detected within the tested load range. The system handled all test scenarios within acceptable thresholds.

**Primary Root Cause:** No breaking point detected (load execution mocked) (confidence: 0%)

## Breaking Point Analysis

No breaking point detected within tested parameters.

## Root Cause Analysis

**Analysis Mode:** mock  
**Confidence:** 0%

### Primary Cause

No breaking point detected (load execution mocked)

### Reasoning

1. Step 1: Telemetry data ingested and analyzed
2. Step 2: Baseline behavior inferred from historical data
3. Step 3: Load tests generated based on baseline
4. Step 4: Load execution pending - results mocked

### Supporting Evidence

- Baseline analyzed: 15 requests
- Top endpoints: 7

## Recommendations

### 1. Run with real k6 execution to detect actual breaking point

**Priority:** 🔴 1  
**Confidence:** 100%  
**Expected Impact:** High - enables actual performance analysis

No rationale provided

## Load Test Results

| Test Type | VUs | Duration | Requests | Error Rate | P95 Latency | Throughput |
|-----------|-----|----------|----------|------------|-------------|------------|
| baseline | 1 | 46s | 152 | 100.00% | 1ms | 3.4 RPS |
| stress | 15 | 258s | 3840 | 100.00% | 1ms | 14.9 RPS |
| spike | 15 | 66s | 1364 | 99.34% | 0ms | 20.9 RPS |

## Telemetry Analysis

**Source:** otel  
**Collection Time:** 2025-12-21 16:37:19 UTC

### Endpoints Analyzed

7 endpoints were analyzed for traffic patterns.

## Methodology

This analysis was performed using SentinelPerf AI, an autonomous performance engineering agent.

### Analysis Pipeline

1. **Telemetry Analysis** - Inferred traffic patterns from available telemetry
2. **Test Generation** - Generated load, stress, and spike test configurations
3. **Load Execution** - Executed tests using k6 load testing framework
4. **Breaking Point Detection** - Identified first point of failure
5. **Root Cause Analysis** - Determined probable cause using observed signals only

### LLM Rules Enforced

- LLM may NOT invent metrics not present in observed data
- LLM may NOT infer causes without supporting signals
- All reasoning is step-by-step and reproducible
- Confidence scores are based on evidence strength only
