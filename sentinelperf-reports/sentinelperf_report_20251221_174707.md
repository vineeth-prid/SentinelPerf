## Executive Summary

The system reached its **breaking point at 50 virtual users** (36.6 requests/second), where error_rate_breach exceeded acceptable thresholds.

**Primary Root Cause:** Error cascade caused system collapse (at 50 VUs, 36.6 RPS) (confidence: 88%)

## Breaking Point Analysis

**Classification:** Error Driven Collapse

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Virtual Users at Break | 50 |
| Requests/Second at Break | 36.6 |
| Failure Type | error_rate_breach |
| Threshold Exceeded | error_rate > 0.05 |
| Observed Value | 0.5187 |
| Threshold Value | 0.0500 |
| Detection Confidence | 85% |

### Observed Signals

- error_rate_breach at 50 VUs
- Observed: 0.5187, Threshold: 0.0500
- Severity: 10.37x threshold
- Error rate: 51.87%
- P95 latency: 703.9ms
- Throughput: 36.6 RPS

### Failure Timeline

| Time | Event | Test Type | VUs | Description |
|------|-------|-----------|-----|-------------|
| t0 | 📈 load_change | baseline | 5 | Load increased to 5 VUs (baseline) |
| t1 | 📈 load_change | stress | 50 | Load increased to 50 VUs (stress) |
| t2 | 🔴 error_rate_breach | stress | 50 | Error rate crossed threshold (51.9% > 5.0%) |
| t3 | 🟠 latency_degradation | stress | 50 | Latency slope changed (27.3x increase) |
| t4 | 🟠 latency_degradation | stress | 50 | Latency exceeded threshold (704ms > 200ms) |
| t5 | 🔴 error_rate_breach | spike | 50 | Error rate crossed threshold (9.2% > 5.0%) |
| t6 | 🟠 latency_degradation | spike | 50 | Latency exceeded threshold (628ms > 200ms) |

## Root Cause Analysis

**Analysis Mode:** ollama  
**Confidence:** 88%

### Primary Cause

Error cascade caused system collapse (at 50 VUs, 36.6 RPS)

### Reasoning

1. Step 1: Analyzed load test results from baseline, stress, and spike tests
2. Step 2: Observed 2 load changes and 5 violations
3. Step 3: First violation at t2: Error rate crossed threshold (51.9% > 5.0%)
4. Step 4: Classification rationale - Errors appeared before or at same load as latency degradation
5.          Error breach at 50 VUs
6.          Errors likely caused cascading failures
7. Step 5: Classified as error_driven_collapse

### Supporting Evidence

- Load tests: 7905 total requests
- Average error rate: 20.4%
- Max P95 latency: 703.9ms
- error_rate_breach at 50 VUs
- Observed: 0.5187, Threshold: 0.0500
- Severity: 10.37x threshold

## Recommendations

### 1. Implement circuit breaker pattern

**Priority:** 🔴 1  
**Confidence:** 80%  
**Expected Impact:** High - prevents cascade failures

Errors cascaded causing system collapse

### 2. Add rate limiting at entry points

**Priority:** 🟡 2  
**Confidence:** 75%  
**Expected Impact:** Medium - trades availability for stability

Protect system from overload-induced errors

## Load Test Results

| Test Type | VUs | Duration | Requests | Error Rate | P95 Latency | Throughput |
|-----------|-----|----------|----------|------------|-------------|------------|
| baseline | 5 | 26s | 285 | 0.00% | 26ms | 11.3 RPS |
| stress | 50 | 123s | 4461 | 51.87% | 704ms | 36.6 RPS |
| spike | 50 | 45s | 3159 | 9.18% | 628ms | 71.2 RPS |

## Telemetry Analysis

No telemetry data was analyzed.

## Methodology

This analysis was performed using SentinelPerf AI, an autonomous performance engineering agent.

### Analysis Pipeline

1. **Telemetry Analysis** - Inferred traffic patterns from available telemetry
2. **Test Generation** - Generated load, stress, and spike test configurations
3. **Load Execution** - Executed tests using k6 load testing framework
4. **Breaking Point Detection** - Identified first point of failure
5. **Root Cause Analysis** - Determined probable cause using observed signals only

### LLM Rules Enforced

- LLM may NOT invent metrics not present in observed data
- LLM may NOT infer causes without supporting signals
- All reasoning is step-by-step and reproducible
- Confidence scores are based on evidence strength only
