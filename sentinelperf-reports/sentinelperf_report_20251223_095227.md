## Executive Summary

No breaking point was detected within the tested load range. The system handled all test scenarios within acceptable thresholds.

**Primary Root Cause:** System capacity exceeds tested load levels (confidence: 70%)

## Breaking Point Analysis

**Classification:** No Failure

No breaking point detected within tested parameters.

## Root Cause Analysis

**Analysis Mode:** rules  

**Confidence:** 70%

### Summary

No breaking point detected within test parameters

### Primary Cause

System capacity exceeds tested load levels

### Failure Pattern

**Detected Pattern:** No Violations

No threshold violations detected during testing

### Contributing Factors

- None identified

### Assumptions

- Load tests accurately simulate production traffic patterns
- Telemetry data reflects actual system behavior

### Limitations

- Analysis based on rules-only (LLM unavailable)
- Low baseline confidence - limited historical data
- Limited timeline events for detailed analysis

## Recommendations

### 1. Increase load test intensity to find actual limits

**Priority:** 🔴 P1  
**Risk:** 🟢 LOW  
**Confidence:** 77%

**Rationale:** No breaking point found within test parameters

**Expected Impact:** Establish true capacity ceiling

### 2. Document current capacity as baseline

**Priority:** 🟡 P2  
**Risk:** 🟢 LOW  
**Confidence:** 84%

**Rationale:** System handled all test scenarios successfully

**Expected Impact:** Reference point for future capacity planning

### Limitations

- Recommendations are guidance, not prescriptions
- Actual fixes require system-specific investigation
- No failure detected - recommendations are exploratory

## Load Test Results

| Test Type | VUs | Duration | Requests | Error Rate | P95 Latency | Throughput |
|-----------|-----|----------|----------|------------|-------------|------------|
| baseline | 2 | 30s | 200 | 5.00% | 200ms | 20.0 RPS |
| stress | 30 | 30s | 3000 | 5.00% | 200ms | 300.0 RPS |
| spike | 30 | 30s | 3000 | 5.00% | 200ms | 300.0 RPS |

## Test Coverage Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Max VUs Reached | 30 |
| Max Sustained RPS | 300.0 |
| Total Requests Executed | 6,200 |
| Longest Load Duration | 30s |
| Spike Severity | Mild (5-20% errors) |
| Recovery Observed | No |

## Telemetry Analysis

No telemetry data was analyzed.

## Methodology

This analysis was performed using SentinelPerf AI, an autonomous performance engineering agent.

### Analysis Pipeline

1. **Telemetry Analysis** - Inferred traffic patterns from available telemetry
2. **Test Generation** - Generated load, stress, and spike test configurations
3. **Load Execution** - Executed tests using k6 load testing framework
4. **Breaking Point Detection** - Identified first point of failure
5. **Root Cause Analysis** - Determined probable cause using observed signals only

### LLM Rules Enforced

- LLM may NOT invent metrics not present in observed data
- LLM may NOT infer causes without supporting signals
- All reasoning is step-by-step and reproducible
- Confidence scores are based on evidence strength only
